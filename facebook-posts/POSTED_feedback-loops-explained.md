🔄 What's a feedback loop? It's nature's way of self-regulation.

When your body gets too hot, you sweat to cool down. When it's too cold, you shiver to warm up. That's a feedback loop in action.

Systems thinking teaches students to:
• Identify feedback loops in biological systems
• Predict how changes ripple through ecosystems
• Understand climate, health, and population dynamics

These skills prepare students for careers in medicine, environmental science, biotech, and more.
